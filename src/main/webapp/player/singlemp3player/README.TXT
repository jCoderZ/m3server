HI GUYS

thanks for downloading my flash single mp3 player. the player supports 
streaming playback and scrubbing of an mp3. Various parameters of the 
player can be set: the file to play, the song volume, autostarting, 
autorepeating, the colors of the player and showing of a downlad button.



INSTALLING

First upload the singlemp3player.swf and the mp3 file you want to play
to your webserver. Then open the html page in which you want the player
to embed. There you can insert the embed code for the flash. If you want 
to use the default parameters of the mp3player, you're done ! 


There are a couple of parameters you can set. You have to set them twice 
in the  code block, one version for Internet Explorer and one for Firefox:

- width(25 or up; the height should always be 20)
- file (default is "sound.mp3", ou can also use an absolute URL)
- songVolume (0 to 100)
- backColor (hexvalue, eg. ff0000 for red)
- frontColor (also hexvalue)
- autoStart (true or false)
- repeatPlay (true or false)
- showDownload (true or false)

The singlemp3player.html included in this download has 3 examples of 
html code. View it in your editor to get the html codes.



USE INSIDE A FLASH MOVIE
 
You can just copy-paste the entire movieclip from singlemp3player.fla to 
your flash movie. If you open the movieclip, all parameters you have to 
change can be found at the top of the actionscript.



HINTS

the singlemp3player is made with Flash 8. The FLA cannot be opened in 
previous versions of Macromedia Flash. You also need the Flash Player 8 
installed in your website for the mp3player to view.

The mp3player accepts only MP3 files and a couple of Shoutcast streams.
